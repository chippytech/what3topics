# 👾 What3Topics  

**A creative 3-word topic generator powered by AI**

Welcome to **What3Topics**, a **free and open-source** platform that transforms your ideas into concise, AI-generated topic descriptions — each expressed in **2 to 5 words**. Built entirely with **Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, What3Topics is lightweight, fast, and simple to use — no servers, no databases, just pure web magic ⚡.

What3Topics has been introduced around August to September 2025.

**Keep in mind the hosted/prebuilt version of W3T does have a proxy named w3tsrv, which has security features like locks to specific servers via CORS, and via the Referrer header as well.
You can run your own Cloudflare Worker to get around it and add your own limitrations. https://github.com/CalmhostAcct/w3tsrv**

## 🧠 About the Project

**What3Topics** was inspired by the idea of *“what3words”* — mapping locations with three random words — but instead of physical locations, we map **ideas**.

Whether you're brainstorming startup names, writing prompts, art ideas, or just having fun generating creative combinations, What3Topics helps you turn randomness into inspiration.

The **👾 alien monster logo** symbolizes creativity, imagination, and the playful spirit of exploration that drives open-source innovation.
